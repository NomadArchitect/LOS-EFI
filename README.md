# LOS-EFI
# **LCARS - Library Computer Access Retrieval System**  
  
LCARS is based on the idea from the TV show Star Trek - Next Generation. Those panels you see on the bridge of the enterprise are known as LCARS displays. Others have attempted to make this, but they made a shell over windows or Linux. Mine is *FROM SCRATCH*, thus not using a linux kernel or anything related to MS Windows.  
  
*NOTE : I make NO MONEY on this project. YES, I'm talking to you CBS ! So you can't sue me or force a take down !*
